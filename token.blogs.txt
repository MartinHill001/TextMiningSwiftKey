can
we

early
?

what

“i
don’t
understand
the
whole
dating
thing
.
i
know
right
off
the
bat
if
i’m
interested
in
someone
,
and
i
don’t
want
them
to
waste
their
money
on
me
and
take
me
out
to
eat
if
i
know
i’m
not
interested
in
that

additionally
,
with
all

i
think
there
are
a
few

to
consider
with

must
embrace
mobile

craft
new

that
tap
the

.
i
wonder
how
they're
going
to
handle
the
collateral
damage
from
their
foolish
statements
?
feeling
a
little
under

right
now

i

i

stay
in

presence
and
you
can
weather
the
storm
with
all
the
peace
that
comes
w/
him

can
i
admit
something
shameful
?
i've
never
visited
jackson
heights!
it's
perhaps
one
of
the
most
written
about
areas
of
queens
for
its
food
,
its
street
culture
,
its
vibrancy
and
life
,
and
yet
,
i've
never
been!
shame
on
myself!
luckily
i
came
to
this
date
armed
with
three
,
count
em
three
,
issues
of

out
new

featuring
queens
,
cheap

,
and
ethnic

,
so
i'd
know
where
to
hit
among
the
clatter
and
bang
that
overtakes
such
an
intersection
of
the
world
.
we
selected
tibetan
cuisine
,
as
tom
had
never
before
tried
the
food
of
yak-country
which
was
all
i
ate
when
i
was
there
a
few
years

,
so
we
walked
into
the
brightest
florescent
packed
merit
kabab
palace
and
headed
to
the
back
counter
of
tashi
delek
momo
,
which
serves
up
a
combination
of
chinese
delights
with
a
tibetan

when
you

you

,
you
stop
seeing
them

you
feel
like
they
are
looking
out
for
your
best
interests
without
digging
around
for
their
commission

though
many

are
concerned
about
the
potential
for

of

been
shown

against

this
is
a

victory
for
the
nation

people
convinced
that
the
hazardous
bi-product

an
unhealthful

many

our
wallets
worth
saving

denis

points
out

not
be
in

position
next
generation
!
the
constitutional
oath
shall
be
as
follows:
picture
this
in
your
head:
a
room
full
of
doors
,
each
one
with
a
different
path
behind
them
.
some
are
shut
,
names
on
them
being
life
choices
you
know
are
not
going
to
work
out
or
have
been
closed
to
you
.
there
are
some
doors
that
are
open
,
with
the
labels
being
life
choices
you
are
considering
,
and
some
that
you
are
not
.
during
the
course
of
your
life
,
some
of
those
doors
will
be
shut
on
you
,
but
one
door
will
always
stay
open
,
and
that
is
the
door
god
is
wanting
you
to
go
through
.
-it
is
not
so
much
that
you
ignore
your
negative
feelings
as
that
you
process
them
incompletely....see
how
your
feelings
are
experienced
in
your
body
.
then
we
went
to
the
tractor
pull
.
the
tractor
pull
was
nolan's
favorite
part
of
the
fair
.
he
thought
it
was
hilarious
when
the
horses
would
start
to
pull
.
you
can't
see
it
in
this
picture
,
but
the
horses
were
really
pulling
an
old
pick-up
truck
with
weight
in
it
.
horses
pulling
a
truck
?
nolan
thought
it
was
great
and
it
kept
him
entertained
through
a
whole
weight
class
.
this
quote
kills
me
.
reading
through
that
issue
of
the
watchtower
brought
a
few
tears
to
my
eyes
.
this
man
is
saying
,
“music.
.
drinking…
drugs…
hair…
.
beard…
clothes….”
when
jesus
is
whispering
in
his
ear
,
“i’m
here
.
choose
me
,
choose
me
,
choose
me
.
i
created
you
.
i
love
you
.
i
want
you
to
be
mine
.
will
you
trust
me
enough
to
let
me
be
your
god
?
your
king
?
your
owner
?
your
lover
?
your
best
friend
?
your
confidante
?
”
despite
all
the
advancements
in
technologies
,
we
have
become
a
society
of
desensitized
,
lethargic
human
beings
dehumanized
so
that
transhumanism
can
be
ushered
.
some
of
us
are
in
a
hypnotic
state
that
we
get
hit
by
cars
and
fall
in
to
ditches
because
we
a
so
glued
to
our
smartphones
.
with
the
destructive
education
system
,
we
are
seeing
a
lack
of
critical
thinking
skills
and
a
dependency
on
calculators
and
spell-check–eliminating
a
developing
brain
to
progress
.
i
must
admit
that
i
am
a
victim
to
the
destructive
of
the
human
mind
,
but
need
end
it
.
1
.
first
,
you
need
special
eggs
called
fertilized
eggs
that
have
the
beginnings
of
a
baby
chick
in
them
.
the
eggs
we
buy
at
the
store
for
cooking
are
not
fertilized
.
they
do
not
have
baby
chicks
starting
to
grow
in
them
.
but
if
you
go
to
a
farm
that
has
hens
and
roosters
,
you
can
get
fertilized
eggs
for
hatching
.
at
first
,
the
baby
chick
is
very
tiny
—
just
a
speck
inside
the
egg
,
but
it
will
grow
until
it
fills
the
egg
and
hatches
out
.
the
following
embellishment
was
created
by
layering
different
elements
together
.
i
started
with
some
tim
holtz
tissue
tape
i
changed
the
color
with
distress
ink
,
added
a
starbust
punched
shape
,
followed
by
a
tim
holtz
gear
,
a
punched
star
,
a
tim
holtz
game
spinner
,
and
finally
a
brad
to
hold
it
all
together
.
then
i
trimmed
the
tape
with
some
pinking
sheers
.
the
place
where
interior
worlds
go
to
die
.
and
people
,
the
butterfly
has
been
cut
out
from
1934
.
i
added
some
distress
stickles
rock
candy
to
it
to
make
it
sparkle
.
the
chipboard
is
from
imaginarium
and
has
been
painted
with
white
gesso
and
distressed
with
distress
ink
walnut
stain
so
has
the
papers
.
rose
from
wild
orchid
crafts
.
15
i
pulled
my
finger
out
,
the
water
started
gushing
to
the
ceiling
again
,
people
were
screaming
,
and
i
slipped
and
fell
in
my
rush
to
find
the
missing
piece
,
which
was
submerged
in
a
corner
.
i’d
just
wrapped
my
fingers
around
it
when
brenda
grabbed
my
calf
to
pull
me
out–
john
had
arrived
.
he
took
one
look
at
the
situation
and
took
his
shirt
off
like
superman
in
the
phone
booth
,
which
is
an
image
that
is
permanently
burned
into
my
brain
.
he
took
the
handle
from
me
and
dove
in
.
in
less
than
a
minute
,
he
had
the
handle
screwed
back
on
and
everything
in
place
.
that
said
,
the
five
of
us
met
over
beer
and
brownies
at
opal
divine’s
prior
to
last
night’s
thunderstorms
and
reaffirmed
our
intentions
to
return
to
the
stage
.
in
the
meantime
,
we’ll
be
getting
together
in
splinters
to
write
songs
and
goof
around
.
reasons
to
stay:
not
on
par
with
pixar’s
other
films
.
mostly
fluffy
,
could
easily
have
been
a
direct-to-cable
film
from
a
story
standpoint
.
it
was
1749
,
just
four
years
after
the
failed
jacobite
rising
,
and
the
defeat
of
bonnie
prince
charlie
and
the
clans
at
the
battle
of
culloden
.
reprisals
had
been
severe;
the
wearing
of
kilt
and
tartan
was
forbidden;
the
rising
was
still
fresh
and
sore
in
everyone’s
minds
and
by
no
means
necessarily
still
over
.
messages
and
money
flew
between
the
prince
in
exile
and
his
loyal
supporter
cluny
macpherson
,
in
hiding
on
ben
alder
.
we
presently
have
a
global
system
that
many
believe
to
be
unsustainable
.
in
other
words
,
our
current
rate
of
consumption
is
outstripping
what
the
environment
can
sustain
long
term
.
we
are
using
the
earth’s
natural
resources
more
quickly
than
the
earth
can
replenish
them
.
moreover
,
current
production
methods
sometimes
result
not
only
in
bi-products
that
harm
the
environment
,
but
also
in
products
that
are
used
one
time
and
then
must
be
thrown
away
.
this
is
a
waste
of
resources
and
it
translates
into
a
waste
of
land
because
the
“one-and-done”
products
are
buried
in
landfills
that
entomb
trash
forever
.
i
believe
these
and
other
behavioral
trends
reveal
that
we
believe
creation
to
be
something
to
be
abused
and
exploited
rather
than
nurtured
and
cared
for
.
but
once
he
tasted
the
deliciousness
that
is
a
saltine
,
he
was
game
and
pretty
much
demanded
that
i
keep
it
up
with
the
supply
at
a
break-neck
pace
.
so
much
for
getting
my
shopping
done
in
a
hurry
.
without
shame
,
i
grabbed
a
handful
of
the
cracker
packets
,
shoved
them
in
my
pocket
,
and
proceeded
to
stop
every
two
feet
to
satiate
my
son’s
need
for
crispy
goodness
.
meanwhile
,
shame
might
be
a
relative
thing
depending
on
whether
one
has
a
fully
functioning
conscience
,
a
holey
conscience
or
no
conscience
at
all
.
people
can
be
ashamed
for
reasons
that
are
unreal
,
or
fail
to
be
ashamed
when
they
really
ought
to
be
.
shame
is
largely
conditioning
and
therefore
is
not
always
an
accurate
measure
of
what
is
truly
right
and
wrong
.

i

you
with
an
everlasting
love;
i
have
drawn
you
with
lovingkindness
.
i
will
build
you
up
again

as
i’ve

,
the
true
objectives
of
clandestine
operations
,
no-matter

,
are
never

from
the
bits
and
pieces
of
news
that
filter
through
,
whether
the
forces
at
work
are
good
or
evil
,
you
will
eventually
get
bogged
down
in
a
grey
area
dotted
with
futile
second-hand
circumstantial
evidence
.
there
will
be
many
of
you
,
like
me
,
who
look
at
the
vast
,
gaping
hole
in
the
‘relevant
experience’
part
on
your
graduate
applications
and
feel
like
crying
.
in
my
darker
moments
,
i
wonder
why
any
employer
would
pick
the
girl
from
the
coffee
shop
over
the
girl
who
has
done
one
million
internships
.
well

i’m
about
to
tell
you

the

served
not
only
a
functional
purpose
that
of
washing
,
scrubbing
and
rinsing
the
laundry

also
a
social
purpose:
they
represented
a
natural
meeting
point
on
a
par
with
the
local
church
,
café
or
market
.
they
fell
out
of
use
in
the
20th
century
with
the
rise
of
domestic
plumbing
and
,
from
the
1950s
onwards
,
the
arrival
of
washing
machines
and
launderettes

in

but
i’ve
come
up
with
a
plan
to
go
and
meet
my
mum
when
she
is
on
her
lunch
break
unless
something
else
comes
up
like
going
over
to
wimborne
,
though
after
yesterday
i
don’t
feel
like
trekking
anywhere
on
a
bus
.
yesterday
i
went
from
pokesdown
to
poole
on
the
bus
with
my
friend
and
it
took
1
and
a
half
hours
.
ugh
so
today
is
one
of
those
blank
days
where
i’m
just
drifting
around
without
much
purpose…i
do
have
some
money
saved
up
but
i
don’t
particularly
want
to
spend
it
today
as
i’m
going
out
shopping
with
georgia
tomorrow

but
not

i
told
him
it
wasn't
about
completing
my
chores
for
me
.
the
help
i
want
goes
like
this:
share
with
me
what
would
make
you
happy,tell
me
what
you
want
to
see
done
.
in
all
aspects
of
our
lives,not
just
the
chores
.
and
then
for
goodness
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
motivation
hold
me
accountable
.
i
think
an
important
thing
to
consider
in
b&w
is
to
not
overdue
the
effect
.
after
i
do
all
my
adjustments
i
take
a
break
and
work
on
a
color
image
or
just
be
away
from
the
computer
for
a
while
.
come
back
,
see
that
you
over
did
it
more
than
fox
news
during
election
season
and
then
bring
it
back
to
a
more
realistic
value
.
when
piazza
went
after
mota
who
played
for
the
dodgers
at
the
time
,
piazza’s
former
team
,
pedro
martinez
who
wasn’t
even
a
teammate
of
either
at
the
time
chimed
in
and
pooh-poohed
piazza’s
anger
.
well
,
not
like
pedro
is
anyone
to
talk
about
going
after
players
.
but
still
,
mota
was
not
very
welcomed
by
mets
fans
,
to
say
the
least
.
at
least
piazza
was
no
longer
on
the
team
,
as
if
that
would
have
stopped
anything
.
you’ll
then
need
to
start
by
preparing
your
chicken
.
if
you
didn’t
buy
cutlets
,
you’ll
need
to
slice
your
chicken
breasts
into
thin
,
long
strips
.
to
make
things
easier
for
yourself
,
when
shopping
look
for
pre-cut
,
thin
sliced
chicken
cutlets
.
you
can
also
buy
your
meat
from
the
grocery
butcher
counter
and
ask
them
to
slice
it
into
cutlets
for
you…
this
is
a
great
route
too
because
you
can
ask
them
to
cut
each
piece
as
close
to
3oz
.
as
possible
.
i
want
to
be
more
than
just
a
person
thriving
with
a
desk
job
.
but
right
now
,
i’m
trying
to
figure
out
what
“more”
i
want
to
be
,
i
want
to
have

a
recurring
theme
in
my
life
is
how
often
i
learn
lessons
about
living
by
making
mistakes
.
i
write
kiss
&
blog
because
airing
my
thoughts
on
dating
and
relationships
helps
with
nailing
down
at
least
a
few
rules
of
engagement
.
falling
flat
on
one's
face
is
a
universal
experience
for
anyone
who
has
ever
had
more
than
one
encounter
with
the
opposite
sex
,
but
i
can't
help
wondering
how
much
better
my
nose
would
look
had
i
been
privy
to
some
inside
skinny
before
i
began
.
your
nose
,
of
course
,
is
as
cute
as
a
button
.
only
in
new
york
is
there
such
witty
banter
use
trip
advisor
ratings
one
of
the
best
i
think
and
similar
sites
as
a
guide
not
as
a
given
.
it
is
not
always
clear
whether
every
rating
is
genuine
and
while
i
hope
they
are
,
it
is
important
to
read
them
with
an
open
mind
.
i
have
read
scathing
reviews
of
hotels
that
i
love
and
vice-versa..
.
these
sites
are
not
definitive
guides
but
they
can
offer
some
insights..
.
and
they
can
also
mis-inform..
.
like
the
time
i
arrived
in
budapest
for
a
weekend
only
to
be
staying
30
kilometres
from
the
centre
of
the
town..
.
my
fault
entirely
because
i
was
naive
enough
to
trust
an
unknown
site
without
double
checking
and
because
i
didn't
do
my
research
properly..
.

i
don't
want
someone
who
feels
it
was
a
great
idea
to
post
gun
sight
images
on
her
web
sites
over
congressional
districts
,
or
opposing
politicians
.
whether
this
was
a
factor
in
the
tragedy
in
arizona
or
not
.
someone
who
aspires
to
be
president
shouldn't
be
this
stupid
and
not
know
that
this
could
possibly
incite
violence
and
unwanted
actions
.
it
was
a
childish
maneuver
period
.
jesus
tells
us
to
believe
in
our
prayers
but
jesus
adds
a
post-script
.
he
says
if
you
are
holding
anything
against
anyone
,
if
we
are
holding
anger
,
resentment
,
bitterness
,
fear
,
worry
,
the
desire
to
dominate
,
guilt
,
sexual
impurity
,
jealousy
,
inferiorities
,
or
lack
of
love
,
then
,
we
must
forgive;
first
!
from
the
sea
,
we
chilled
on
the
beach
,
getting
to
know
each
other
better
and
sharing
stories
from
home
and
breaking
cultural
stereotypes
.
once
more
we
took
to
the
sea
,
laughing
as
we
asked
to
see
miss
july
and
miss
october
,
as
ingrid
got
nik
to
take
pictures
of
her
in
the
water
.
after
another
couple
of
hours
chilling
in
the
sun
we
decided
it
was
time
to
make
a
move
.
the
five
hours
on
the
road
were
well
worth
the
four
hours
we
enjoyed
on
the
beach
.
stop
by
and
take
a
look
looking
forward
to
a
busy

busy
,
busy
spring
<U+2665>
as
you
can
tell
i’m
not
that
happy
about
the
whole
thing
,
but
i
suppose
it’s
better
than
having
none
of
my
writing
published
at
all
.
it’s
bad
enough
that
my
last
poem
to
be
published
in
an
anthology
got
printed
with
a
typo
that
changed
the
whole
meaning
of
that
particular
line
,
but
in
my
eyes
this
is
even
worse
.
i
just
wish
they
could
have
thought
of
me
highly
enough
to
be
able
to
make
edits
to
my
own
writing
myself
.
sit
with
me
a
minute
.
pull
up
your
chair
,
turn
down
your
music
.
it's
been
so
long
since
we've
talked
.
i've
needed
these
2
months
and
13
days
of
silence
to
live
with
the
last
9
months
and
6
days
i
have
lived
without

who
had
been
text
messaging
family
members
,
despondent
and
possibly
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
and
medication
in
hotel
room
.
police
also
discovered
a
lengthy
suicide
note
.
maybe
you
don't
have
the
same
heritage
that
i'm
blessed
with
.
but
you
can
be
the
first!
you
can
stand!
and
in
standing
,
teach
your
children
to
stand!
i'm
not
just
talking
about
marriage!
i
have
friends
that
have
lost
their
spouse
at
a
young
age
,
friends
that
have
lost
children
,
friends
that
have
lost
everything
they
own
in
a
fire
,
an
auntie
that
is
battling
her
seventh
round
of
cancer
,
friends
that
have
been
through
tremendous
difficulties
in
their
marriages
.
to
be
around
these
people
is
a
joy!
what
a
testimony!
what
an
incredible
example
.
do
you
know
what
this
says
to
people
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
?
it
says
,
"i've
been
that
way
before
and
i'm
here
to
show
you
that
you
will
make
it
through
to
the
other
side!"
the
battalion
had
been
given
their
marching
orders
what
seemed
like
eons
ago
.
since
that
time
,
they
had
fought
battles
,
lost
dozens
of
men
in
those
battles
and
as
many
more
to
exhaustion
,
exposure
,
near-starvation
and
dehydration
.
they
were
poorly
supplied
,
supported
only
by
a
handful
of
vehicles
.
food
and
water
were
luxuries
.
what
little
they
were
given
was
frequently
spoiled
or
polluted
.
dysentery
had
taken
its
toll
along
with
the
other
battles
the
troops
had
fought
.
dimly
,
xu
guan
recalled
that
they
were
to
rendezvous
with
more
troops
at
some
place
he’d
never
heard
of
–
omaha
,
nebraska
.
by
then
,
xu
guan
reasoned
during
a
rare
moment
of
clarity
,
they
would
be
fortunate
if
there
was
even
a
single
platoon
left
of
the
original
battalion
.
today
in
psychology
class
we
were
talking
about
wearing
masks
throughout
your
life
.
sometimes
those
masks
are
needed
,
such
as
when
you're
at
work
vs
when
you're
with
your
friends
.
most
of
the
time
,
you
can't
act
the
same
in
both
places
.
so
when
you're
at
work
or
with
your
friends
you
wear
the
appropriate
mask
.
those
are
,
apparently
,
"healthy
masks"
.
i
raised
my
hand
and
asked
"what
are
unhealthy
masks
?
"
i
knew
the
answer
already
,
if
i
had
just
sat
and
thought
about
it
i
would've
figured
it
out
,
but
i
was
too
quick
to
get
an
answer
.
or
maybe
it
was
just
something
that
i
needed
to
hear
,
rather
then
think
.
he
said
"an
unhealthy
masks
is
one
you
wear
after
a
trauma
,
emotional
or
physical
.
sometimes
it
becomes
second
nature
and
you
don't
even
think
about
it
anymore
,
it
becomes
a
part
of
you
.
eventually
though
,
your
two
worlds
collide
and
your
unhealthy
mask
will
fall
and
your
healthy
mask
will
prevail."
i
just
laughed
to
myself
because
could
he
be
reading
my
mind
or
know
my
situation
any
more
?
i
mean
,
really
?
trauma
?
unhealthy
masks
?
apparently
i
am
,
in
fact
,
a
cliche
.
with
over
2
billion
viewers
the
world
cup
is
also
the
world’s
biggest
live
televised
event
.
it
dwarfs
any
event
previously
hosted
in
south
africa
.
the
fact
that
every
global
news
and
press
agency
will
converge
on
south
africa
will
greatly
magnify
the
impact
of
any
attack
.
such
global
news
coverage
is
a
further
factor
that
would
make
a
terror
attack
on
the
world
cup
a
very
attractive
proposition
for
al
qaeda
.
and
did
he
get
a
lot
of
stick
from
predominantly
english
audiences
for
being
german
?
ab

establishes
a
uniform
review
process
in
the
event
that
an
unclaimed
property
claimant
disagrees
with
the
administrator’s
decision
regarding
the
status
of
a
claim
.
my
husband
is
always
using
my
body
scrub
and
then
complaining
about
it
smelling
"girly"
how
is
grapefruit
girly
?
.
so
,
i
made
him
his
own
.
we
also
have
a
birthday
to
celebrate
hi
heather!
and
some
work
to
do
.
that
t
word
.
maybe
we
will
finish
our
secret
yellow
project
.
but
what
makes
the
draft
at
least
bearable
for
me
are
the
blunders
.
year
after
year
somebody
messes
up
,
and
you
have
to
turn
on
your
twitter
windshield
wipers
to
clear
through
all
the
jokes
and
laughs
people
have
about
it
.
last
year
it
was
the
vikings
and
titans
taking
their
quarterbacks
way
too
early
.
a
few
years
ago
it
was
the
raiders
going
with
sirdropsalot
darius
hayward-bey
see
,
jokes
.
and
then
there’s
my
favorite
,
eli
manning
nearly
in
tears
as
he
was
drafted
first
overall
by
the
chargers
.
“momma
i’m
not
going
to
play
there
.
they
can’t
make
me
no
no
no
no.”
trucks
also
deliver
other
essentials
.
fuel
delivered
to
metropolitan
areas
through
pipelines
is
not
accessible
to
the
public
until
it
is
distributed
by
tanker
trucks
to
gas
stations
.
instead
,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
some
other
things
made
illegal
because
our
legislators
believe
they
are
looking
out
for
the
well
being
of
their
constituents
.
and
even
if
those
responsible
just
really
and
truly
didn’t
know
any
better
–
i
can’t
imagine
that
someone
that
did
know
better
didn’t
advise
them
against
it
,
and
advise
them
to
wait
.
