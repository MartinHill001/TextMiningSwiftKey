by
jean

.
this
popular
symphony
is
deceptive
.
it
requires
a
particular
kind
of
mental
virtuosity
from
a
conductor
because
the
work
is
built
from
discontinuities
.

made
the
edges
of

fragments
sharp

silences
and
by
not
taking

.
the
layered
expression
of
these
broken
fragments
in
the
development
,
and
their
simultaneous
combination
during
the
recapitulation
were
balanced
with
great
care
and
they
made
an
impressive
impact

much
of
